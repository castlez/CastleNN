#Neural Network
###by Jonathan Castle

This is a simple neural network using the tutorial found at http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html

##Note: this doesnt work because i chose to use Double precision floats instead of integers for logical OR. Going to be retrying this in a better suited language using integers, but keeping this around because the algorithms are good, but oop is a pain for this stuff.
